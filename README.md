# Loggo

A logging system implemented as a part of the courswork for Design Patterns.

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository
* From the root of the repository, run `make` to generate all the object files, and the final executable

```bash
#!/bin/sh
git clone git@github.com:thazhemadam/loggo.git
cd loggo
make
./loggo
```

* All header files belong in the `include/` directory
* All source files belong in the `src/` directory
* All object files are generated in the `bin/` directory
* The `Makefile` must be updated everytime a new file is added in either directory, appropriately.
* Object files are generated in `bin/` following the same directory structure as observed in `src/`.
